Example project to demonstrate a concept of how to share computational research openly meeting important reproducibility demands.

To access the project, first make sure you have Docker installed. Then open a terminal (on Windows your Docker environment), change into this directory and run the script access_lab_YOUR-OS.sh, replacing YOUR-OS with linux, mac or windows7.

For example on Linux

$ cd ~/open-comp-rsc
$ source access_lab_linux.sh

To view the lab notebook open your browser and navigate to the address as instructed from the terminal.

To reproduce data, try for example repeating the simulation with the label 18e35e47 with the command

$ smt repeat 18e35e47
